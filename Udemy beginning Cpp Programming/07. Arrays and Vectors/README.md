## Vector Library in C++

Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.

### Some useful functionalities of vector library:
* How to declare 1D vectors: `vector <data_type> vector_name {initial_value};`
* How to declare 2D vectors: `vector <vector <data_type>> vector_name {initial_value}`
