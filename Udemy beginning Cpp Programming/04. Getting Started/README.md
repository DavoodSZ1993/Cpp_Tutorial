* `#include <iostream>`: `iostream` should be included to read or write to the standard input/output systems.

* `using namespace std`: Tells the compiler that the symbol names defined in the `std` namesspace are to be brought into your program's scope. Also, symbols can be selected individually, i.e. `using std:: cout` and `using std:: endl`.
