Variables can be declared in the C++ as: `data_type variable_name {initial_value};`

Data types in C++:
* Boolean: `bool`
* Character: `char`
* Integer: `int`
* Floating point: `float`
* Double floating point: `double`

The `const` keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant and tells the compiler to prevent the programmer from modifying it. A constant variable can be declared in C++ as follows: `const data_type variable_name {initial_value}`.
