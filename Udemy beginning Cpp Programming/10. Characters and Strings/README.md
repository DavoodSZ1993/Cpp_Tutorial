## C++ string Library
* `getline()`: reads characters from an input stream and places them into a string.
* `erase()`: Erases all elements that compare to equal to the value from container.
* `at()`: It returns a reference to the character at position in the string.
* `substr()`: It returns a newly constructed string object with its value initialized to a copy of a substring of this object.
* `length()`: It returns the length of the string in terms of bytes.
* `find()`: It searches the string for the first occurance of the sequence specified by its arguments.

## string::npos in C++
* It is a constant static member value member with the highest possible value for an element of type `size_t`.
* It actually means until the end of the string.
* It is used as the value for a length parameter in the string's member functions.
